PREFACE
This work represents a new and thoroughly revised edition of a Tibetan-Gorman
Dictionary, which appeared in a lithographed form between the years 1871 and 1876.
During a residence, which commenced in 1857 and extended over a number of
years, on the borders of Tibet and among Tibetan tribes, I and my colleagues gathered
the materials for this Dictionary.
We had to take primarily into account the needs of missionaries entering upon new
regions, and then of those who might hereafter follow into the same field of enterprize.
The chief motive of all our exertions lay always in the desire to facilitate and to hasten
the spread of the Christian religion and of Christian civilization, among the millions of
Buddhists, who inhabit Central Asia, and who speak and read in Tibetan idioms. .
A yet more definite object influenced my own personal linguistic researches, in as
much as I had undertaken to make preparations for the translation of the Holy Scrip-
tares into the Tibetan speech. I approached and carried forward this task by way of
s careful examination of the full sense and exact range of words in their
common usage. For it seemed to me that, if Buddhist readers were to be brought into
contact with Biblical and Christian ideas, the introduction to go foreiga and strange a
train of thought, and one making the largest demands upon the character and the imagi-
nation, bad best be made through the medium of a phraseology and diction as simple,
as clear, and as popular as possible. My instrument must be, as in the case of every
successful translator of the Bible, so to say, not a technical, but the vulgar tongue.
Thus, in contrast to the business of the European philologist, engaged in the same
domain, who quite rightly occupies himself with the analysis and commentary of a lite-
rary language, the vocabulary and terminology of which he finds mainly deposited in
the speculative writings of the Buddhist philosophers, it became my duty to embrace
every opportunity, with which my presence on the spot favoured me, to trace the living
Mowers of words and of expressions through their consecutive historical applications, till
reached their last signification in their modern equivalents, as these are embodied in
the provincial dialects of the native tribes of our own time.
These circumstances, it is hoped, will excuse and explain the system of my work.
As an inventory of the whole treasure of the language, as a finished key to its lite
ratare, this Dictionary, when judged by the high standard of modern lexicography, MAY
seem inadequate; I have, for instance, been unable to consult, much as I could have wished
to have done so, all the original and translated treatises in Tibetan which, down to the
present, have appeared in Europe, and the reader of a Tibetan work may thus, here and
there, look in vain for the assistance he expects. On the other hand, a consistent attempt
is here made for the first time, 1. to give a rational account of the development of the
values and meanings of words in this language; 2. to distinguish precisely the various



transitions in periods of literature and varieties of dialect; 8. to make sure of each step
by the help of accurate and copious illustrations and examples. I have done my utmost
to arrive at certainty where, beretofore, much was mere guess-work, and I cherish the
hope that, from this point of view, my contribution will be welcomed by the comparative
philologist, and will be serviceable to the general cause of learning, as well as a useful
volume within that narrower circle, whose requirements I was specially bound not to
overlook, of persons whose main purpose is to be taught how to write and speak the mo-
dern Tibetan tongue.
There are two chief periods of literary activity to be noticed in studying the origin
and growth of Tibetan literature and the landmarks in the history of the language. The
first is the Period of Translations which, however, might also be entitled the Classical
Period, for the sanctity of the religious message conferred a corresponding reputation
and tradition of excellence upon the form, in which it was conveyed. This period be-
gins in the first half of the seventh century, when Thonmi Sambhota, the minister of
king Srongtsangampo, was sent to India to learn Sanskrit. His invention of the Tibetan
alphabet gave a twofold impulse: for several centuries the wisdom of India and the in-
genuity of Tibet laboured in unison and with the greatest industry and enthusiasm at the
work of translation. The tribute due to real genios must be awarded to these early pioneers
of Tibetan grammar. They had to grapple with the infinite wealth and refinement of
Sanskrit, they had to save the independence of their own tongue, while they strove to
subject it to the rule of scientific principles, and it is most remarkable, how they managed
to produce translations at once literal and faithful to the spirit of the original. The first
masters had made for their later disciples a comparatively easy road, for the style and
contexts of the writings, with which the translators had to deal, present very uniform fea-
tures. When once typical patterns had been furnished, it was possible for the literary
manufacture to be extended by a sort of mechanical process.
A considerable time elapsed before natives of Tibet began to indulge in compositions
of their own. When they did so, the subject matter, chosen by them to operate upon,
was either of an historical or a legendary kind. In this Second Period the language shows
much resemblance to the modern tongue, approaching most closely the present idiom of
Central Tibet. We find a greater freedom in construction, a tendency to use abbreviated
forms (thus the mere verbal root is often inflected in the place of a complete infinitive),
and a certain number of new grammatical combinations.
The present language of the people has as many dialects, as the country has provinces.
Indeed, as in most geographically similar districts, well nigh every separate mountain
valley has its own singularities as to modes of utterance and favourite collocations of words.
Especially is it interesting to note, in respect to pronunciation, how the old consonants,
which would seem to have been generally sounded and spoken twelve centuries ago, when
the Tibetan written character came into existence, and which, at any rate, are marked by
the primitive system of writing, remain still extant; every one of them can still be disinterr-
ed, somewhere or other, from some local peculiarity of language, and thus even the very
diversity of modern practice can be made to bear testimony to the standards imposed by
what was termed above the Classical Period. (Compare my Essay on the Phonetic System
of the Tibetan language in the Monthly Reports of the Royal Academy of Science at
Berlin 1867, p. 148 etc.)
I have already adverted to the circumstances which, especially in the case of the
student, who has for immediate object to learn how to read and write the Tibetan laoguage,
render existing dictionaries almost if not quite useless. They give but scanty information
concerning modes of construction, variations and limits of actual application, shades of



meaning etc. In my own ease, I was forced from the beginning to compile my own
German-Tibetan dictionary, and found myself for all practical purposes thrown back upon
my own resources. But the cause of truth appears to require a further word or two in
regard to the Lexicon by Professor I. J. Schmidt of St. Petersburg, the relation of that
work to its predecessors having been left by its author in some obscurity.
The first Tibetan dictionary, intended for European students, was published at Seram-
pore, as long ago as 1826. It contains the collections, amassed in view of a dictionary
and grammar, by a Roman Catholic missionary, who was stationed in eastern Tibet or
close to the frontier in Bhotan. There was nothing to assist him, except the scanty con-
tributions, given by Georgi, in his Alphabetum Tibetanum. He had to cope with an
entirely unworked language. He evidently took the one way possible of making acquaint-
ance with it, sufficient to enable him to understand, to speak, to read and write. Each
word or sentence was jotted down, as soon as it was heard, or was committed to writing,
at the request of the learner, by some native expert. After a while, the attempt could be
made to master a book. In the instance of our missionary, Padma Sambhava's book of
legends appears to have been selected, a work which represents rather a low level of li-
terature, yet just on that account, perhaps, as a specimen of popular and current literature,
not unsuitable to start from. Then, step by step, as best he could, our missionary had to
possess himself of some abstract views, which would serve as a preliminary basis for a
grammar. And had it been granted to this first occupant of the field to reduce his materials
to an ordered system and to prepare them himself for publication, it is possible, that in
Europe the knowledge of the Tibetan language might have reached, some fifty years
earlier, the stage at which it has now arrived. The very name of that Roman Catholic
missionary, however, has been lost. The papers which he left behind him, unsorted and
unsifted, came into the hands of Major Latter, an English officer, and were passed on
by him to Mr. Schröter, a missionary in Bengal. English was substituted for the
Italian of the manuscript, and the East India Company made a grant which defrayed the
cost of the Tibetan types and the further expenses of printing. But there was no Tibetan
scholar to correct the proofs. The author himself would doubtless, on
have detected and dismissed much erroneous or unnecessary matter. As it was, many
additional mistakes crept in during the passage through the presy. Thus the work, though
it has a richer vocabulary than can be found in the later dictionaries, cannot on any
questionable point be accepted as an authority, and has only value for those who are al-
ready competent, for themselves, to weigh and decide upon the statements and interpre-
tations it advances. I have not been able to extract from it much that was serviceable to
me. Nevertheless, any one who knows by experience what time and toil such a work
must have cost, though its design remained unfulfilled and its object unaccomplished, will
not easily be able to repress his indignation at the tone, in which this book in the preface
to his Grammar (P. VI) is recklessly and absolately condemned by Professor Schmidt
High praise, however, is awarded by the Professor to a second work, the Tibetan-
English Dictionary by Csoma de Körös, which appeared in 1834. This work deserves
all ealogy; but the Professor's manner, which imitates that of a master commending a
pupil, is, though on other grounds, as unwarranted and as offensive in this as in the former
case. The work of Csoma de Körös is that of an original investigator and the fruit of
almost unparalleled determination and patience. The compiler, in order to dedicate him-
self to the study of Tibetan literature, lived like a monk for years among the inmates of a
Tibetan monastery. It is to be regretted that, with the knowledge he certainly must have
possessed of the later language and literature, he should have restricted the scope of his
labours to the earlier periods of literature, and when in his Grammar conversational



phrases are quoted as examples, they are almost without exception in the dialect of the
Kangyar, and of little practical value.
This Tibetan-English dictionary by Csoma has been adapted for a German public
by Professor I. J. Schmidt of St. Petersburg. The translation from English into German
is good; in the general alphabetical arrangement improvements have been introduced,
and such as are in conformity with the spirit of the language; moreover, three Mongolian
dictionaries have been consulted, and from these a certain number of words have been sop-
plemented. But it eannot be said that even on the work of revision Professor Schmidt
has bestowed much pains. For example, Csoma's rough grouping of words under the prin
cipal headings is left unaltered, though here especially a reduction to alphabetical order
was obviously required. Mistakes and superfluities, very pardonable in the case of a first
issue of an original publication, are repeated in this translation, and these cannot be so
readily overlooked and condoned, when they are made at second hand, and are sanetioned
and subscribed to by one, who has assumed so severe a critical and editorial attitude.
The national dictionaries of Tibet itself, so far as I bave met with sucli, are either
little handbooks, meant only to furnish a correct orthog
antiqunted forms. The absence of an alphabetical order in them makes the business of
reference very troublesome. It is by great good luck that one sometimes finds an other
wise unknown word after a prolonged search.
My own dictionary, in the main, pargues the object and accepts the plan of the work,
which was published by Mr. Schröter. As I said at the beginning, I have not restricted
myself to the Classical Period, but I have endeavoured to deal with the Tibetan language
as a whole, though I do not pretend to have performed this task exhaustively. My die
tionary derives its matter and its principles, so far as possible, equally from the literature
and from the speech of the people. Each word has been made the object of observation
in its relation to the context as it occurs in books, and in its value and place among
others when it is used in common conversation, and then the attempt has been made to
define its range and to fix its meaning,
All the words, cited by Csoma and Schmidt, even such as I myself had never seen
or heard, I have embodied in this work, stating, in each case, the source from whence I
drew them.
The signification in Sanskrit bas been added, whenever this seemed likely to be
useful or interesting to the student of Tibetan literature. Of proper names only the most
important are given.
The great number of diacritical marks will perhaps prove irksome to the English
reader; yet, they were not to be dispensed with, if the pronunciation of Tibetan letters
and words was to be represented with any degree of exactness, and the method of Prof.
Lepsius seemed the most eligible among all the systems available for my purpose. The
student, however, need not be disheartened, as he is not obliged to make himself acquaint-
ed with all the minutiae of the system, but need only direct his attention to the peculiari-
ties of that dialect, within the limits of which his inquiries, for the time, are confined.
And by-the-by it may be observed, that the multitude of little marks, of manifold descrip-
tion cannot be startling to the Indian reader, who was ever necessitated to make himself
familiar with systems quite as complicated, as e.g. the Urdu alphabet.
One word more of apology. Of publications in general it has been said, that
"when human care has done its best, there will be found a certain percentage of error".
And the probability is but too great, that this dictionary will exhibit a number of defi-
ciencies and faults, in the English text as well as in the Tibetan transcript. Still, I ven-
ture to hope that an indulgent Publie will be ready to make every reasonable allowance,



in consideration of the peculiar difficulties, which attach to the execution of a work like
present, and which, moreover, were not a little increased, in this instance, by the
fact that the compositors of the press were altogether un acquainted with English.
I should be guilty of great ingratitude, if I were not to mention my obligations to
two friends, without whose kind and efficient and it would have been impossible for me,
in my present infirm state, to complete this work, which was commenced in the days of
health and vigour, viz. to the Rev. T. Reichelt, formerly a Missionary of the Moravian
Church in South Africa, and to Mr. F. W. Petersen, a relative of mine.
Further, I desire to record my obligations for various acts of kindness, encouragement,
assistance and advice, during the prosecution of my researches and the completion of my
work, to A. C. Barnell Esq. M. R. A. S., in India; Dr. E. Schlagintweit in Bavaria,
Dr. Thomson and Dr. Aitchison of Kew, Dr. Kurz of Calcutta, and R. Laing Esq.
M.A., Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.
Not the least debt of gratitude is that which I owe to Dr. R. Rost in London, Secre-
tary of the Royal Asiatic Society, to whose exertions, indeed, the execution of this work
is, properly speaking, entirely due, inas much as he kindly interested the Indian Govera-
ment on behalf of my undertaking.

5mya etc.
**) ra, when combined as second letter, with k-, t- and p-sounds is written under
the first, in the shape of , thus: ,kra, 5 tra, bra eto. - When com-
bined with another consonant as first letter, it is written over the second, thus:
Trka, mia, rda etc., but it is seldom heard in speaking,
The so-called Sanskrit Cerebrals are represented in Tibetan letters by 2.

and when in this dictionary they are transcribed, they are marked by a dot underneath:
1,!,!,,.
The figure (wa-zur or small wa) attached to the foot of a letter, is often used to
distinguish homonyms in writing, e.g. sa hot and ssa (fwa) salt.
The dot, which stands at the end of every syllable and of every word, is called Tseg
(trey) and is indispensable for a correct writing or reading.
When stands as a prefix, it is, when transcribed, represented by y, e.g. FTSATT
ydig, 15" ytam etc.
VOWELS.
The alphabetical order of the vowels is: 4, 1, 1, e, o; they have in Tibetan the same
sound as they have in German, Italian, and most other European languages: a sounds
like the English a in "far', like ee in 'peer' or i in "pin', like u in 'rule' or in "pall',
like a in 'fate' or e in 'met', o like o in 'note' or in 'not'.
As the vowel a is inherent in every consonant, so that even a single letter may form
a word, e.g. ba (cow), ' *a (earth), there is no special character or letter required
for this vowel. The other four vowels are represented by little hooks, standing for i,
for, for e, for o. The marks for i, e, o are placed over the letter, that for u ander
it. Examples：པད་མ་ pad-ma, རི་ , མེ་ ang, བུ་མོ་ bu-a0.
The letter is used as a basis for initial vowels, thus: Wa 'a-ma; the letter
serves as a basis for initial and final vowels: འོ་མ་ -ma, དགའ་ dga.
The vowel-sounds of Q, when transcribed, are indicated by the mark:
3.M . , whilst the W-vowels are denoted by the mark placed over the re-
spective letters: ', , ' '. - The real nature of the letters and
W is treated of in the latter part of the Introduction.
Whenever is a prefixed letter, the mark., in transcribing, is put under the con-
sonant following the aeg. 35 du, a gro-ba.
Nou. For a ready finding of words' in the Dictionary, it should be borne in mind,
that the articles are arranged in the alphabetical order of the initial consonants and their
preved and superscribed letters. Thus: _57- 0------ - A L A-
etc. etc.
II. PRONUNCIATION.
With regard to the language, with which I am dealing, it must, on the one hand,
be admitted, that distinctions between sounds and, especially, variations in the mode of
expressing their values as embodied in a written character, are far more numerous in
Tibetan than either in Sanskrit or Hindi, in which two languages there is really little or
no opening for mistake or ambiguity in this respect. But on the other hand, Tibetan is



scarcely more irregular than French pronunciation, and a few definite rules enjoy univer-
sally recognized acceptation.
There is, however, one special difficulty in the case of Tibetan which, at the present
stage of that language, renders it practically impossible to set up an equable and notho-
ritative standard of pronunciation, and this is the existence of a great number of indepen-
dent and well-defined dialects. An attempt to deal partially with this difficulty, - to
append, let me suppose, to every word from three to five different pronunciations would
involve a waste of time and an extension of space quite disproportionate to the value of
the result. And yet, if one has to strike a preference in favour of one particular dialect,
it is very hard to determine, which is to be selected. At first sight, it might seem the
most natural course to fix upon the speech of the best educated classes in the capital city
Lhasa. But when this method was followed, or when at least on endeavour was made to
act upon it, by Georgi and then by Schröter, only scant approval was bestowed upon
it by European critics, and there were and are several reasonable arguments to be urged
against its adoption. Of all the dialects this presents to the European ear and tongue the
greatest difficulties, and accommodates itself least readily to the written character. More
over, in my own case, I have to add that I do not consider myself sufficiently master of
it to care to risk its application to each individual word. Besides, modern political cir-
cumstances make this dialect, for the present, the least available for general use.
Csoma chose a much more manageable and a mach more widely circulating mode
of pronunciation, though one which presents problems of its own, when it has to be fitted
to the written character: the West-Tibetan dialect. Here again, in representing ench
separate word, one has, in reality, to make choice between two, three or four pronuncia-
tions, of which one agrees best with the written character, another conforms closest to
the rules of spelling, a third recommends itself as that most frequent in conversational
language. In my own smaller Tibetan dictionary I went no farther than to distinguish
between two principal groups, which I termed West-Tibetan and Central-Tibetan; but
in a more scientific work like the present I may permit myself to call more minute nt-
tention to the niceties and refinements of the language before us. I have, accordingly,
published a number of specimens from my note-book, in which I kept a collection of
ical words, of which I availed myself as often as I had the opportunity of meeting the
representatives of remote districts, and of enquiring concerning their manner of speech
at home. Whenever in this collection a word had not been entered on sound native
authority, or had not been sufficiently discassed, I preferred to mark it with a note of
interrogation, and not to allow any conclusion from analogy, or any theory of pronun
ciation to interfere with the design of my liandy-book and its simple and unprejudiced
statement of fact. I may therefore, I hope, claim for this list a high degree of trust-
worthiness, even among collections of the kind, into which words can sometimes have
slipped, as they had been heard once, and perhaps were not heard again.
In order to denote the pronunciation, I follow the scheme of Professor Lepsius.
Some objections have been urged against this scheme; yet, amongst all systems of the
kind, so far as I have become acquainted with them, I have no hesitation in affirming
that of Professor Lepsius to be the best, and it is certainly also that most appropriate
my purpose, A thorough study of the Standard Alphabet by R. Lepsius, 2 edi-
tion, London, Williams and Norgate. Berlin, Hertz, 1863' may be recommended to all
persons, who interest themselves in phonetie investigations. As I can scarcely take it for
granted, that the work mentioned will be already in the hands of every one, who may
consult my dictionary, I shall endeavour, as briefly as possible, to indicate its essential
plan and principles. Its rules may be stated as follows:



In order to mark sound, Lepsins uses the letters of the ordinary Latin alphabet.
Where these are insufficient, he calls in the aid of a few Greek letters. Letters are used
with the powers they most generally possess in European languages. (Thus z bas its
usual force, and does not stand for the peculiar sound is, which belongs to it in the Ger-
mau language alone.) Sounds which lack exact representation are indicated by diacritical
warks, placed above or below the letters which most nearly correspond. Every simple
sound is represented by one and only one simple mark. Explosive and fricative conso-
nants (these terms will be explained below) are denoted by different letters.
The following marks or signs are for poucels: the well known sign for a short, and
() for a long vowel; the mark of a modified vowel , German , 0, 0, is placed by Lep-
wins, for practical reasons, below, not above the vowel (..); a dot under the vowel
denotes a close vowel sound e s in fate, o in note); a horizontal line under the vowel
denotes a more open vowel sound in there', o in 'or, cord', which, indeed, supersedes
the a mentioned above); the mark above the vowel indicates a nasal quality, the
breath passing, while uttering the sound, to a considerable extent through the nose the
French 'an, in, on, un'- ,,,).
In marking consonants, there is first the distinction to be noted, that they are partly
explosives, formed by a rapid process of closing and re-opening the passage of the air at
a certain point, partly fricatices and liquids, formed by a partial process of compressing
or narrowing the air-passage; and secondly, they are distinguished in regard to the ex-
act spot, where the process of articulation takes place. The lowest articulation takes
place in the faucal region, close to the larynx (here, for example, his formed): next
comes the guttural region, at the throat, near the soft palate and uvula (here k is formed);
it is marked, when necessary, with a dot above the consonant; then the palatal region,
the hard palate, (here the German ch is formed in 'ich"); the mark is a stroke like the
acute accent in Greek over the consonant; then the dental region, at the teeth and gums
(a, t, , sh), and finally the labial region, at the lips (b, P, m). There exists a further
class of consonants in the Indian languages, and also in modern Tibetan, which are
styled cerebrals; they are most of them modified dentals, formed by bending or curling
the tongue upwards, and bringing the tip of it into contact with the hard palate in the
centre or toward the hinder part of its roof; mafk, a dot under the consonant.
Many of these letters, in order to become audible, require in pronouncing them a
certain vocalic effort; others, to say the least, allow or suggest such an effort; the mark
of these vocalized consonants is a small ring under the letter. When this vocalic effort
is made by the medium of the nasal channel alone, the oral passage being simultaneously
closed at some one of the points indicated above, we get the nasal consonants as a result.
When the stoppage is made at the guttural point, ng is obtained to be marked ); at
the dental point, n; at the labial point, m. In order to conform with the two final rules,
cited above from Lepsius, the Greek letter z is used to represent the German ch, when
it is guttural and hard, as in the word "doch'; use is made of the Greek 7, when it is soft
or accompanied by a vocalic tone (the Dutch g): 1 gives the force of a palatal ch (Ger-
man 'ich' - 'milch' – milt); } is used to represent the strong English th (as in
through'); d renders the softer or vocalized tone (as in 'that'); a hard, sharp and hissing
sorss (as in 'yes', 'press) is marked as s; the soft vocalics (as in 'his', 'rise') is repre-
sented by z; the hard rushing sound sh, German sch, is rendered by *; the sound of the
French j by :. If one attempts to give at the palatal point, where the English y (in
year'), or the German (in Jahr') is formed, the sound sh, German sch, one obtains the
palatal, or the softened and vocalized. In the Dictionary: and have been substi-
tated for these marks.



X11
Further, in many languages, what are properly combinations of two consonants come
to be regarded as simple forms, this happening, either because they are gradual growths
upra an original simpler form, or because they have a natural affinity to each other. Thus
properly dental sibilants should be distinguished thus: ts, de; but for the sake of simpli-
city Lepsius, in his second edition, marks them and, or, with their palatal force, è
and) (instead of and ;).
A further example of the combination of consonants is presented in what is known
as aspiration, when the letter is brought into more or less intimate connexion with
another consonant. This introduces us to a very important distinction, belonging to the
Tibetan langunge, which it is necessary to explain at some length, in accordance with
which explosive consonants, as they have the force of tenues, medine, or aspiratae, are
treated. The tenues are produced by a sudden opening of the air-passage at one of the
points above mentioned: throat, teeth, lips, such opening being unaccompanied by any
sensible operation of the breath whatsoever. Thus, when quite exactly sounded, k, hp,
are produced. The mediae, &, a, b, are produced by the same process, carried out in a
milder and less abrupt way, (the peculiar English pronunciation will come under con-
sideration later). The aspiratae require a decided pressure by the breath (they will be
found marked by the spiritus asper above the letter: 1,5 p). In northern Germany, in
England, and in Scandinavia, modern educated speech recognizes only mediae and aspi-
ratae, for we give an aspirated sound to every k, and p. The French and the Magyars
distinguish consciously the pure tenues from the mediae; on the other band they ignore
the aspiratae. Tibetan pronunciation makes room and requires a mark for all three gra-
dations. Nay more, it augments the class of explosive consonants or mutae by the ad-
dition of the dental sibilants in all three ranks or grades of aspiration: 3, 5, and 3,
, E, or according to the Standard Alphabet: ,,) and ts, fs, de. At a later stage of
the language some further modifications were introduced, which we shall subsequently
allude to.
Let us now, passing from these general observations, draw attention to a few details
of the Phonetic Table, which has been drawn up in deference to a wish that reached me
from several quarters.
The first column of the Table, now under review, gives the ancient literal pronun-
ciation, as it was in vogue in the seventh century of our era, and was settled at the time
of the invention of the alphabet. Such a pronunciation relies, after all, for ita justification
on the hypothesis, that the inventors of the alphabet had for their first object to re-
produce, as exactly as possible, an artistie reflection of the natural value of sounds as
spoken by their contemporaries: that, therefore, a later pronunciation is most in con-
formity with the original genius of the language, if it gives with the greatest distinctness
a special power to each written character. A reference to the Table will amply illustrate
the fact, that a pronunciation, adopted on these principles, has actually maintained itself
in one or the other provincial dialect, and it is very interesting to notice that the purest
and most striking forms of this survival have their homes in those districts, which are
most remote from and least subject to the disintegrating and dissolving influences of the
actual centre of Tibetan civilisation, the capital Lhasa. Thus the prefixes and the super-
scribed consonants, for the most part, are still sounded at each extremity of the whole
territory, within which the langange is spoken, both on the Western and the Eastern
frontier, alike in Khams, which borders on China, and in Balti, which merges into Kash-
mere. Moreover, in both localities the same minor irregularities occur, transgressions
against an exact rendering of the pronunciation according to the letters, the same frequent
transformations of the tenues into the aspiratae, gandd (compare lower down) becoming
y orx, 5 becoming w. Now, about twenty degrees of longitude separate Balti from Khams,



and the former, embracing Islam, long since cat itself adrift from spiritual and religious
cohesion with Tibet, and there, too, the dialect in other respects has greatly dete
has admitted many foreign elements and has fallen altogether from the position of a lite-
rary Inngange. The resemblances and correspondences noted can, therefore, scarcely be
accounted for in any other way, than by assuming that an old and strong instinct of speech
lived on in oral tradition for more than ten centuries on the outskirts of the Tibetan do-
main, which in the intermediate provinces has gradually surrendered and submitted to
the spirit of change.
Columns 2-6 contain, on most pages, the provincial dialects in their geographical
sequence from West to East. The dialects of Ladak, Lahoul and Spiti correspond to
what in my smaller Tibetan dictionary I called the dialect of Western Tibet. The last
named, Spiti, represents in some respects the transition to the dialects of Eastern Tibet,
under which heading Tsang and are to be classed. At the date of the publication of
my former dictionary I was unacquainted with the dialect of Khams. Where a space is
left vacant in the columns, the provincial pronunciation agrees with the model provided
under column 1. Towards the end of the Table, where the anomalies become much more
frequent, I have for the sake of clearness repeated the word.
The sign 4 (which does not occur in this Table) was pronounced l or in the
substantive terminations ba and bo (v. Dict. p. 362), viz. = the English w, so that
sounded exactly like the French word roi.
The Accent has seldom been marked, because, as in our Teutonie dialects, it gene-
rally rests on the root of the word. In the case of compounds, it more frequently falls on
the last than on the first of the component parts. But accentuation, altogether, is not of
great significance in this language.
With regard to Quantity, vowels are pronounced shorter, even in open syllables,
than is the onse for instance in England and Germany. This applios particularly to the
Central Provinces. Absolutely long vowels occur only as a peculiarity of dialect. They
indicate that is consonant has been dropped, in most provinces, s, in U, s, in Tsang, I.
A long vowel may also indionte the blending of vowels. But when in and Tsang the d,
(as in Wup) and when in Lahoul the g (as in fo', gu'-rón) is partially dropped, the vowel
likewise maintains a short abrupt pronunciation. Moreover, the region, to which I have
just referred, is that in which the spoken language has been greatly affected by a foreign
linguistic principle. A system of Tones has been introduced under manifestly Chinese
auspices. I am told by European students of reputation, who have made the Tonie lan-
guages of Eastern Asia their special department, that only the first principles of what
are known as the high and low Tones, have made their way into Tibetan. Here, as
in the languages of Farther India, generally, which possess an alphabetic system of writ-
ing, the Tone is determined by the initial consonant of the word. This I have generally
indicated in column 7, which columa applies only to the Spiti, Tsang and U dinlects. The
system of Tones, as in Sinta and elsewhere, has become of paramount importance in de
termining distinctions between words. An inhabitant of Lhasa, for example, finds the
distinction between and , or between and not in the consonant, but in the Tone,
pronouncing and with a high note (as my Tibetan authorities were wont to describe
it'with woman's voioe', shrill and rapidly), and 3, on the contrary with a low note,
and, as it appeared to me, more breathed and floating. This latter distinction is still more
apparent with regard to those low-toned aspirates, that in the course of time were intro
duced in Central Tibet instend of the mediae, in contraposition to which now the original
aspirates are used as high-toned; so more particularly in the dialect of Spiti. The low-
toned aspirate I have indicated by h, the high-toned by the mark of the spiritus asper



Those letters of the alphabet, which as simple initial consonants have a deep tone, be
come with a superscribed letter or with a prefix high-toned, so also l, when subscribed.
The tepes remain, it would appenr, unaffected by the Tone. With reference to the mo-
difying effect of a final, d, and, in different provinces, the Table may be consulted.
The characterisation of the rushing sounds as 'palatals' is no doubt correct and agrees
with the generally prevailing pronunciation; but the learner need not consider it as being
of much importance.
The two letters, and tal, introduce us to a very interesting linguistic phenomenon.
We meet here with the idea of the rouel absolute, the pure vocalie note, freed altogether
from any presence of a consonant. This vowel-tone is rendered by the letter of the
alphabet , in contradistinction to WN, which represents the Semitic , the spiritus lenis
of the Greeks, the audible re-opening of the air passage of the larynx. The difference
may be observed, for example, in the manner of uttering the words, the lily, an endo
and in the pronunciation of 'Lilian' (a name), in Tibetan art and A . Thus,
whenever in the middle of a word one vowel succeeds another (hence also in all diph-
thongs), is used. Again, in Tibetan, as in every form of human speech, it cannot but
be the commonest of occurrences for a vowel to follow a consonant, and the strict rule
might seem to require the vocalic tone to be always indicated, which, according to Csoma,
was originally done. However, as the Tibetan language, adopting the principle from
Sanskrit, deems the sound of a to be naturally inherent in every consonant, while the
other four vowels, as mere subspecies of the vowel absolute, are indicated by little books
above or below the letter, and as the end of a syllable is always marked by a dot (called
sey), the function of in this capacity was soon seen to be quite superfluous. Its use is
necessary only to obviate ambiguities, when for instance one of the five letters, used as
prelixes precedes a consonant with a; e.g. the word would be read 'wad', whereas
159, written thus, implies that the vowel does not precede but follow the consonant d,
and consequently the m is prefix, and the word to be read mda'. If the vowel is not a,
the sigu of such vowel suffices, e.g. mdo; 5* wdao, standing now for 857
Some practical difficulty attends the pronunciation of the pure vowel as an initial letter.
In order that the effect of the consonant may not be produced, it is necessary, after
opening the larynx, to allow the tone gently to set in and then to let it gradually gain
fulness and force. I shall indicate this process by the mark. The sound would be
urately represented than it is in the Table, thus: adr-po,wug-pa ele. Im-
proper are the expedients of some of the dialects, the sound being hardened to y in
Khams, to w in Western Tibet; Also Csoma's device of indicating it by an his inade-
quate. This is a case in which the true pronunciation has been preserved in the Central
Provinces, perhaps, because it almost necessarily implies the effort connected with the
low Tone, above referred to, so that, when the invading system of Tones had here estab-
lished its authority, it acted as a conservative element.
Finally, this vocalie tone can be used in connexion with certain consonants. It is
unnecessary to indicate it in Tibetan, when it accompanies liquidae (, , ,, 1) and
sibilnote; but with the motae it must be marked, where the effect is that, with which we
are familiar in the case of the English medine, b, d, gj, for instance in be, do, go, jew.
In Tibetan the vocalie effect accompanies aspirates too, and is marked by placed as a
prefix, which I transcribe thus g. 25 che = the English do. The pause on the tone



is of course in the case of mutae a very short one. Here again, though only in the case
of the medine, we find this peculiarity preserved in its purity in Central Tibet. It is not
difficult to understand, how, if one is careless about closing the nasal pasange, a nasal
articulation of this prefix can easily grow common. This has happened throughout
Khams, and in the rest of Tibet at least in compound words; at Lhasa it is considered
inelegant, as is also the sounding of any prefix. On the other hand, the dialect of Central
Tibet neglects the distinction between 1 and and pronounces the former only as a
vocalic initial. In words from the Sanscrit the is used in some respect as a 'mora', to
dennte a long syllable, og for it; hence the opinion of Lamas of Lbose, that it ex-
presses prosodical length, when used as above in 8159
' wyn, is not found in use in any of the dialects. The sole confirmation of its liter-
al pronunciation depends upon the word myah-be which, perhaps a thousand years ago,
found its way into the Ba-Dan language (Tibar-skad, Cunningh.) and which the people of
Lahoul, when spenking Tibetan, pronounce nyar-tea. The process of transition to the
cerebral f-sounds in the words krad-pa etc. is in many places not yet completed, 60
that the sound of r is still more or less clearly distinguishable. The Prenies have al
ways constituted the most perplexing phenomena in the Tibetan language, At the time
of the invention of the alphabet they mast have represented a sort of anticipatory sound
in close connexion with the initial consonant of the word. Certain seeming impossibili
ties of pronunciation, when one has, for instance, to deal with a prefix together with a
threefold initial consonant ( , ) become less formidable, and not more embarrass-
ing than those which meet us, for example, in the Polish language, when we ascertain
that in Balti and Khams the three explosive prefixes are pronounced as fricatives, in
which case e must be written for w. Thus Toyo-wa, wkra, a wsgrage
call for no greater exertions, than do the Polish chcicy, wkrótce, wskrok. Our strongest
ground for suming this fricative pronunciation to be that of antiquity is, I think, that,
had it been explosive, words like u s would have coincided with T, Yet
it must be acknowledged that a pronunciation bèu, bka ete, exists, side by side with me,
toka etc. - , as a liquid, offers no difficolty. - , as a prefix, is no consonant.
A doubt must still cling to 5, and I do not venture to determine its ancient pronun-
ciation. It is by a strange anomaly that, in most dialects, when prefixed to , both it and
the initial consonant die away into a spiritas lenis; and almost still more singular it is,
that where it still asserts an independent force, in Khams and in Balti, it is sounded like
with the power of y. The investigations of Lepsius go indeed to prove that 5 and on
are complements to each other; but how came, at the beginning, two letters to be chosen
as signs for one and the same sound? Most probably the original sound was d, which
then very soon passed into y. The variations between r and sin Ladak afford no sure
hold for drawing inferences.
The purpose, for which the Phonetic Table was drawn up, will have been attained,
if I succeed in convincing my readers, 1. that for scientific objects the pronunciation, as it
is given in Column 1, is the most suitable, and that with a good conscience it can be re-
commended in the place of that introduced Ly Csoma; 2. that its system is regular enough
to render it unnecessary to give the pronunciation of every individual word throughout
the work; 3. that I present in this Table, in regard to the various dialects, as much in
the way of results as down to the present, it has been possible for European students to
acquire and to put into shape for the service of a European publie.

Final remark. The Tibetan words, given in the Vocabulary, are not in every instance
to be regarded as exact equivalents for whatever word happens to be sought, but rather
as hints, how to attain to the wished for expression. It will, therefore, be frequently in
dispensable to refer to the Tib. Engl. Dictionary for further explanation, and to examine
the different bearing and relations of the word in question, so far as they may have been
traced there. - Although this Vocabulary is by no means complete in itself, yet it is to
be hoped that it will not prove quite unuseful, but answer the purpose for which it was
intended.



CORRECTIONS.
A revision of the Dictionary has brought such a number of misprints to light that, on second thoughts, it
seems absolutely necessary not to leave them noticed, but to register all that are of any consequence. The
unfortunate fact that such corrections should be required, has to be ascribed to two circumstances, in regard
to which the reader's Indulgence has already been appealed to in the Preface, namely, the author's weak state
of health, and the difficulties with which the printing of a book of this character is necessarily attended.
